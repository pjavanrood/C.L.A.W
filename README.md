This group project was a part of the APSC101 course at UBC. The purpose was to design a claw that collects a variety of objects in different shapes,  sizes, and weights. Credits to my team V8 for doing such a great job.
We started by brainstorming and exploring different ideas of what our claw is going to look like, and after sketching concepts, we tried to combine all the great features of those ideas and turn them into a design.
The mechanism of the claw is such that the ultrasonic sensors will measure the distance of the nearest object, and if it was below a certain level, the servo motor will start rotating and closing the gap. So when the sensors detect an object, the claw will close.
